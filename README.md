# Xylophone


The goal of this project was to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation.

With this project I've learned:

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The difference between 'if let' and 'guard let'
